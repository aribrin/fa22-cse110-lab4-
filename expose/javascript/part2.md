5. the code return an error because i is not defined within the scope
6. the code return an error because discountedPrice is not defined within the scope
7. the code prints 150 because finalPrice is defined within the scope of the console.log() call
8. the code returns [ 50, 100, 150 ]  because discounted is defined within the scope of the console.log() call
9. the code return an error because i is not defined within the scope
